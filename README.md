# Pocketchat

PocketChat is a real-time chat application demo built using Pocketbase (a lightweight backend solution) and Svelte (a modern frontend framework). This demo app showcases how you can create a simple yet functional chat system using a combination of powerful technologies, while being deployed on a $5 Linode server for an affordable yet performant solution.

Features
Real-time messaging (using WebSockets)
User authentication via Pocketbase
Basic chat room functionality
Modern, fast, and reactive UI built with Svelte
Deployed to a low-cost Linode server
Why Pocketbase & Svelte?
Pocketbase provides a simple backend with built-in real-time data synchronization, authentication, and file storage. It allows developers to quickly prototype applications without needing to set up an entire server-side stack.
Svelte offers a minimalistic approach to building web applications by compiling your components into efficient JavaScript at build time, rather than using a virtual DOM like other frameworks. This results in fast, lightweight, and highly responsive applications.
